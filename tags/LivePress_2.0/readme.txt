LiveJournal Crosspost Plugin for WordPress

-------------------------------------------------------

== Description ==

Live+Press is a Live Journal compatibility plugin for Word Press. Features include support for LiveJournal Tags, Moods, Music, User Pictures, posting to a LiveJournal account and synching edits to LiveJournal originally posted using Live+Press or manually configured to be edited with Live+Press. Version 2.0 is an update on Version 1.99.9 which is an updated version of Unteins' Live+Press 1.5.2 and 1.99 (my initial 'fixes' were incorporated into the latter version by Unteins). The original plugin can be found here: http://somuchgeek.com/. I did not write this plugin, I only 'tweaked' it for use with more recent versions of WordPress, therefore I can not offer support for the plugin. Details of most of my changes can be found here: http://www.creepigurl.com/2006/how-to-break-livepress/. Some changes I neglected to document.

== Installation ==

To install Live+Press perform the following steps:

*  Unzip archive and upload the entire "LivePress_2.0" folder to the "wp-content/plugins" directory.
*  IMPORTANT! Replace the class-IXR.php found in the wp-includes directory of your WordPress install with the class-IXR.php included with the plugin. Alternatively, you could edit the existing class-IXR.php.     
*  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
*  Visit the 'Live+Press' options page to configure the plugin. You must add your LiveJournal information (user name and password) and give permissions to the appropriate WordPress users in 'Journal Configuration' (click the 'Add Journal' link).
*  Note - the visual text editor will need to be turned off in order for LivePress to work properly. This is a per user setting and the option can be found the 'Edit User' screen of your WordPress install (untick the 'Use the visual editor when writing' box). Also, you will want to disable XXX as this feature will try to 'close' the LiveJournal tags in your post.
*  Optional - if you wish, edit LivePress.css (currently 'empty').
